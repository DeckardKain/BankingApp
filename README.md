Hi!

Stay a while, and code...

I started building this app as a basic demonstration of the SOLID principals that I could add in my portfolio to potential employers.

S = Single Responsilibity
O = Open/Close
L = Liskov Substitution
I = Inverse of Control
D = Dependency Inversion

What I discovered was that it was pretty quick and easy to demonstrate SOLID principals and a worth while activity because it gets your mind
aware of the various techniques you are using. For example, you have used Dependency Injection all over the place but its not the same as 
Dependency Inversion. The difference is Dependency Inversion is a principal and Dependency Injection is a technique to adhere to that principal.
The observer pattern also follows DIP (Depenency Inversion Principal). You may use DI all the time but its important to understand what principal
it is following.

So with SOLID principals already defined, I decided that this isn't enough to showcase in my portfolio. I decided to create a full end to end web app,
that communicates its data over a public API (RESTful) while adhering to SOLID and as well as show casing different design patterns and utilization of
techniques/features such as generics (very useful for repository and data services).

Please feel free to add feedback. I am always looking to improve and by no means am I saying that this is they way you must do things.

You may also use this app freely as a solid base app to start something new. Its fairly generic so you can definitely add a lot to it.

I am currently not finished this, I still have some work to do on the front end and coding up the rest of the program and functionality I want to add.

Thank you,
